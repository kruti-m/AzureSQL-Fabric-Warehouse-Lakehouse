# Domain Security

A domain is a logical grouping of workspaces.
A data mesh is a decentralized data architecture that organizes data by specific business domains, such as marketing, sales, human resources, etc.

Domain incorporate federated data architecture via data mesh approach. It provides for an IT centric data architectures, where the data is governed and managed centrally, to more federated models organized according to business needs.

When a workspace is associated with a domain, all the items in the workspace are also associated with the domain, and they receive a domain attribute as part of their metadata.
